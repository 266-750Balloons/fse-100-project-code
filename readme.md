# ASU FSE 100 Group 9 Final Project Source Code
This Github repository contains the source code for our robot. Here is a breakdown of what is in each file:
- Ultrasonic Sensor Tests
    - ```bentriangle.m```
    - ```nwtest.m``` (The original test)
    - ```sumo.m```
    - ```teststuff.m```
- Abstraction Code/Tests
    - ```moveforward.m```
    - ```test.m```
- Platform experimentation Code from sumo battle
    - ```sumo2.m```

Also note that attribution is a bit confusing. Ben wrote most of these files, in part because we didn't yet have a Github repository to share the code between us and all the files were on his computer. The initial code commit is attributed to me, 266-750Balloons (Drew), though, because I was the one who created the repo.

In addition, the directory structure is subject to change. We're keeping it simple for now and just doing a flat structure, but as we solidify the project design, it is likely that we will have an src directory for code intended for the final prototype and a test directory where most of the current demos will likely end up.
